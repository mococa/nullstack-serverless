# Nullstack Lambda

## Explanation

If you want to run a nullstack app in an AWS lambda, here is an example of a [CDK construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) that will do all the dirty job for you.

The nullstack construct is found in

```bash
.
‚îú root
‚îî‚îÄ infrastructure
    ‚îî‚îÄ lib
        ‚îî‚îÄ null-stack.ts
```

## What does it do

1. It creates an s3 bucket to host all the public files
2. It creates a private s3 bucket to host the build files. in it, there will be a folder, with an index.js, where it uses [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express), where it gets the Express server in Nullstack and converts it into a lambda function; in this folder there is also the node_modules of this external package, and a .production folder from nullstack (changed server.js in it removing the crossorigin attribute - [explained here](https://github.com/nullstack/nullstack/pull/355))
3. It deploys the necessary files into these buckets
4. It creates a lambda that will run the files in the build bucket
5. It creates an API Gateway with the route `/` and the route `/{proxy+}` for the rest of the routes.
6. It creates a lambda function url for it to be accessible.

### Image trick

For images, for not trying to access the public folder assets. I created a nullstack component for it, that tries to get the one in the CDN first:

```tsx
/* eslint-disable nullstack/no-unused-vars */
import Nullstack, {
  ImgHTMLAttributes,
  NullstackClientContext,
} from "nullstack";

type ImageProps = ImgHTMLAttributes<HTMLImageElement>;

export class Image extends Nullstack<ImageProps> {
  render({
    project,
    children,
    environment,
    instances,
    page,
    params,
    router,
    settings,
    ...props
  }: NullstackClientContext<ImageProps>) {
    return (
      <img
        {...props}
        src={`${
          project.cdn?.endsWith("/")
            ? project.cdn.slice(0, -1)
            : project.cdn || ""
        }/${props.src.startsWith("/") ? props.src.slice(1) : props.src}`}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

### Pros ‚úÖ

It turns out to be blazingly fast ‚ö°‚ö°
The lambda runs very quickly and the impression it gives is that it's not even online, as there is both offline cache and s3 cache.

In this example, I used a server function to store the amount of time we clicked the button (and displayed it), although it's obvious that it resets after the lambda dies, it's still super fast and testing it on a phone and on a computer hitting refresh, feels like it's even doing some websockets, but it's just pure HTTP magic refreshing the data.

### Cons ‚ùå

Having [this issue](https://github.com/nullstack/nullstack/pull/355) can be annoying.
Having to change a minified js file after building everytime is just not good, but as soon as it gets fixed or merged, it'll be good to go to production.

I'm not a CDK pro (yet), so the code may contain some mistakes that are free to get fixed by you ü´µ if you spot any.
